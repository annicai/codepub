Preparation:

1. Install Python 2.7 and required libraries.
   The easiest option is to install Anaconda: https://www.continuum.io/downloads

   Many libraries are install by default when installing Anaconda.
   However, matplotlib and Keras need to be installed.
   conda install matplotlib
   pip install keras

2. Test your installations by running "python test.py", which imports the required libraries

3. Install Jupyter notebook, http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.htm
